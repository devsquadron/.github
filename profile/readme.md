# Devsquadron

We enable highly technical leaders to manage their own projects.

We do this by:
1. Bringing project management into the terminal and eliminating context switching
2. Allowing technical leaders to better offload work, in their editor of choice, as they write code
3. keeping the taskboard true through tireless automation
4. Helping small technical teams stay minimalist and agile
